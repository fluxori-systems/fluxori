# Fluxori Security Architecture

This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture for the Fluxori platform, designed to protect sensitive data and operations in the South African e-commerce context.

## Security Perimeter and Defense-in-Depth Strategy

Fluxori employs a multi-layered security approach with the following key components:

### 1. Network and Infrastructure Security

- **VPC Service Controls**: Create security perimeters around sensitive resources
- **Private Google Access**: Services access Google APIs without public internet exposure
- **Cloud Armor WAF**: Protect against common web vulnerabilities and attacks
- **DDoS Protection**: Mitigate distributed denial-of-service attacks
- **Regional Considerations**: Specific configurations for the Johannesburg region

### 2. Identity and Access Management

- **Least Privilege Principle**: Fine-grained IAM roles based on job functions
- **Service-to-Service Authentication**: Secure interactions between system components
- **Custom IAM Roles**: Purpose-built permissions for specific Fluxori functions
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: For administrative access
- **Conditional Access Policies**: Based on location, device, and risk

### 3. Data Protection

- **Secret Management**: Centralized credential management with Secret Manager
- **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit for all sensitive information
- **Field-level Encryption**: For PII and payment information
- **Data Classification**: Based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements
- **Data Residency Controls**: Ensure South African data stays in approved regions

### 4. Application Security

- **Authentication Guard**: Firebase Auth integration for user authentication
- **API Security**: Request validation, rate limiting, and payload inspection
- **CORS Policies**: Restrict cross-origin requests
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevent XSS and other injection attacks
- **Security Headers**: Including HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

### 5. File and Content Security

- **Secure File Storage**: Object-level ACLs and signed URLs
- **Malware Scanning**: For all uploaded files
- **File Type Restrictions**: Whitelist of allowed file formats
- **Content Validation**: Verify file contents match declared types
- **Access Control**: Time-limited, scoped access to files

### 6. Monitoring and Incident Response

- **Cloud Monitoring Integration**: With custom security metrics
- **Real-time Alerting**: For suspicious activities and policy violations
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized logging
- **Automated Response Playbooks**: For common security scenarios
- **South African Compliance Monitoring**: POPIA-specific controls

## Threat Model

The following key threats are addressed by this architecture:

1. **Data Exfiltration**: Prevented through VPC Service Controls and DLP policies
2. **Credential Compromise**: Mitigated with Secret Manager and MFA
3. **Service-Level Attacks**: Protected by Cloud Armor and rate limiting
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Controlled through least privilege and IAM
5. **Malicious File Upload**: Secured via content scanning and validation
6. **Regional Considerations**: Network variability and compliance risks in South Africa

## Security Compliance

This architecture addresses requirements from:

- **POPIA (South Africa)**: Data protection and privacy requirements
- **PCI DSS**: For payment processing integrations
- **ISO 27001**: General security control framework
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Implementation Principles

All security implementations will follow these principles:

1. **Security as Code**: Infrastructure and policies defined as code
2. **Defense-in-Depth**: Multiple overlapping controls
3. **Secure by Default**: Conservative security posture with opt-in relaxation
4. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights
5. **Principle of Least Surprise**: Intuitive security interfaces
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring of security events

## Security Module Boundaries

The security architecture respects the existing module boundaries:

- **Auth Module**: Handles user authentication and identity
- **Feature Flags**: Controls security feature activation
- **Observability**: Provides security monitoring and alerting
- **Storage**: Secures file operations
- **Agent Framework**: Secures AI model interactions

This architecture will be implemented in phases, with continuous security validation throughout the process.
