# Circular Dependency Analysis Report

## Identified Circular Dependencies

I've identified a potential circular dependency between the UI and Motion libraries:

### Dependency Chain:

1. `src/lib/ui/hooks/useComponentAnimation.ts` imports from:

   - `src/lib/motion/context/MotionContext.tsx`
   - `src/lib/motion/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts`
   - `src/lib/motion/hooks/useConnectionQuality.ts`
   - `src/lib/motion/utils/animation-strategy.ts`

2. `src/lib/motion/utils/animation-strategy.ts` imports from:

   - `src/lib/motion/context/MotionContext.tsx`
   - `src/lib/motion/utils/motion-tokens.ts`

3. `src/lib/motion/gsap/gsap-core.ts` imports from:

   - `src/lib/motion/hooks/useConnectionQuality.ts`
   - `src/lib/motion/utils/motion-tokens.ts`

4. Multiple UI components depend on `useComponentAnimation` which creates a dependency on the Motion module.

## Root Cause

The circular dependency is caused by the tight coupling between the UI and Motion modules. The UI module uses animation capabilities from the Motion module, while some parts of the Motion module might depend on UI components or hooks.

## Suggested Solution

1. **Create a shared interface layer**: Extract shared types and interfaces into a separate module that both UI and Motion can depend on.

2. **Apply Dependency Inversion**: Instead of direct imports between modules, use a dependency injection pattern:

   - Create abstract interfaces that both modules can implement
   - Use context providers to inject implementations at runtime

3. **Restructure the Motion library**:
   - Move `useConnectionQuality` and related utilities to a separate utilities module
   - Ensure Motion components only depend on Motion hooks and utilities
   - Create adapter patterns for UI-specific functionality

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new shared module: `src/lib/shared/types/motion-types.ts`
2. Extract types and interfaces into this shared module
3. Update imports to use the shared definitions
4. Apply the dependency inversion pattern to break circular references
5. Update the component implementations to use the new structure

This will separate the concerns between UI and Motion modules while maintaining the network-aware functionality that's critical for South African market optimization.
