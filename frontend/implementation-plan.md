# Implementation Plan: Resolving Circular Dependencies

## Phase 1: Create Shared Types and Interfaces

1. Create a new shared types module:

   ```
   src/lib/shared/
   └── types/
       └── motion-types.ts
   ```

2. Extract shared types and interfaces:
   - `ConnectionQuality`
   - `NetworkCondition`
   - `AnimationMode`
   - `AnimationParams`
   - `AnimationStrategyConfig`

## Phase 2: Implement Dependency Inversion

1. Create abstract services for motion functionality:

   ```
   src/lib/shared/
   └── services/
       ├── animation-service.interface.ts
       └── connection-service.interface.ts
   ```

2. Implement provider pattern for injecting implementations:
   ```
   src/lib/shared/
   └── providers/
       └── service-provider.tsx
   ```

## Phase 3: Refactor Motion Module

1. Reorganize module structure:

   ```
   src/lib/motion/
   ├── animations/       # Animation-specific code
   ├── connection/       # Network connectivity code
   ├── contexts/         # Context providers
   └── components/       # UI components
   ```

2. Create adapter implementations for motion services:
   ```
   src/lib/motion/
   └── services/
       ├── animation-service.impl.ts
       └── connection-service.impl.ts
   ```

## Phase 4: Refactor UI Module

1. Update UI components to use service interfaces:

   ```ts
   // Before
   import { useConnectionQuality } from "../../motion/hooks/useConnectionQuality";

   // After
   import { useConnectionService } from "../../shared/services/connection-service.interface";
   ```

2. Create UI-specific animation helpers that don't depend on motion directly

## Phase 5: Create Service Registration

1. Implement a registry pattern for services:

   ```ts
   // src/lib/shared/services/service-registry.ts
   export const ServiceRegistry = {
     registerAnimationService: (impl) => {...},
     registerConnectionService: (impl) => {...},
     getAnimationService: () => {...},
     getConnectionService: () => {...}
   };
   ```

2. Register implementations in the application entry point

## Benefits

1. **Decoupled Modules**: UI and Motion modules become independent
2. **Testability**: Services can be easily mocked for testing
3. **Flexibility**: Different implementations can be swapped based on environment or user preferences
4. **Clarity**: Dependencies between modules become explicit and controlled
5. **Maintainability**: Changes to one module won't unexpectedly affect the other

## Timeline

1. Phase 1 (Create Shared Types): 1 day

4. Phase 4 (Refactor UI Module): 2 days
5. Phase 5 (Create Service Registration): 1 day
6. Testing and Validation: 1 day

Total: 8 days of development work
