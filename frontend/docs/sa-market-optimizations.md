# South African Market Optimizations

This document outlines the specific optimizations implemented in the Fluxori UI component library to address the unique challenges of the South African market. These optimizations focus on network performance, data efficiency, and usability under varying connectivity conditions.

## Background

South Africa presents unique challenges for web applications:

1. **Variable Network Conditions**: From high-speed fiber in urban centers to slow, high-latency connections in rural areas
2. **Data Costs**: Mobile data remains expensive compared to global standards, making data efficiency critical
3. **High Latency**: Even with decent bandwidth, latency to servers can be high due to geographical distance from major cloud regions
4. **Intermittent Connectivity**: Many areas experience regular network disruptions
5. **Device Diversity**: Users access applications from a wide range of devices, from high-end smartphones to entry-level models

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Network-Aware Animations

Our animation system automatically adapts to network conditions, using several techniques:

```typescript
// Detect network conditions with South African-specific thresholds
const CONNECTION_THRESHOLDS = {
  // Downlink speed thresholds in Mbps
  POOR_DOWNLINK: 0.5, // Very slow (rural areas, 2G EDGE)
  LOW_DOWNLINK: 1.5, // Slow (3G in congested areas)
  MEDIUM_DOWNLINK: 5.0, // Average (good 3G/weak 4G)

  // RTT thresholds in ms - critical for SA conditions
  POOR_RTT: 600, // Very high latency (rural areas)
  LOW_RTT: 400, // High latency (weak signal)
  MEDIUM_RTT: 200, // Average latency
};
```

Each component can enable network-aware optimizations with the `networkAware` prop:

```tsx
<Card
  animated={true}
  animationType="fade"
  networkAware={true} // Enables network-aware optimizations
>
  Card content
</Card>
```

### 2. Animation Strategy Pattern

The animation strategy pattern adapts animation complexity based on detected network conditions:

```typescript
// Animation strategy specifically for South African network conditions
if (networkAware && preset.reduceNetworkAnimations) {
  switch (networkCondition) {
    case "poor":
      // For very poor connections (2G)
      return {
        ...baseParams,
        durationMultiplier: baseParams.durationMultiplier * 0.5,
        useSimpleEasings: true,
        reduceComplexity: true,
        maxActiveAnimations: Math.min(baseParams.maxActiveAnimations, 1),
        disableStaggering: true,
        scaleMultiplier: 0.5,
      };

    case "slow":
      // For slow connections (3G)
      return {
        ...baseParams,
        durationMultiplier: baseParams.durationMultiplier * 0.7,
        useSimpleEasings: true,
        reduceComplexity: true,
        // Additional optimizations...
      };
    // ...more conditions
  }
}
```

### 3. Data Saver Mode Support

Components respect Data Saver mode, which is popular in South Africa due to high data costs:

```typescript
// Detect and respect Data Saver mode
if (result.isDataSaver) {
  result.quality = "poor";
  return result;
}
```

### 4. Typography Optimizations

Typography is optimized for low-bandwidth connections:

```typescript
// Optimize font size display for network conditions
let optimizedFz = fz || presetStyles.fz;
if (
  shouldSimplify &&
  typeof optimizedFz === "string" &&
  ["5xl", "6xl", "4xl"].includes(optimizedFz)
) {
  // Down-scale very large fonts on poor connections
  optimizedFz = {
    "6xl": "4xl",
    "5xl": "3xl",
    "4xl": "2xl",
  }[optimizedFz] as Size;
}
```

### 5. Layout Optimizations

All layout components (Stack, Grid, Container, Card, etc.) adapt to network conditions:

```tsx
// Simplify styling when on slow connections
const shouldSimplify =
  networkAware && (isDataSaver || networkQuality === "poor");

// Custom styles with token integration
const cardStyles: React.CSSProperties = {
  ...getVariantStyles(),
  ...getIntentStyles(),
  borderRadius: getRadius(theme, radius, undefined),
  boxShadow: shouldSimplify
    ? "none"
    : shadow
      ? getShadow(theme, shadow, undefined)
      : undefined,
  // ...other styles
};
```

#### Stack Component Optimizations

The Stack component optimizes spacing and disables animations on poor connections:

```tsx
// Apply simplified spacing for data saver mode or poor connections
if (networkAware && (isDataSaver || quality === "poor")) {
  // Reduce spacing to optimize rendering and improve performance
  if (typeof gapValue === "string") {
    switch (gapValue) {
      case "xl":
        tokenTracking.trackToken("network-optimize-spacing");
        return (
          <MantineStack
            ref={ref}
            gap="lg" // Reduce from xl to lg
            className={`${combinedClassName} stack-network-optimized`}
            {...props}
          >
            {children}
          </MantineStack>
        );
      case "lg":
        tokenTracking.trackToken("network-optimize-spacing");
      // Reduce from lg to md
      // ...similar pattern
    }
  }
}
```

#### Grid Component Optimizations

The Grid component implements intelligent responsive simplification for poor connections:

```tsx
// Grid.Col with network-aware responsive behavior
if (networkAware && (isDataSaver || quality === "poor")) {
  // For poor connections, simplify responsive behavior
  if (typeof span === "object" && !("span" in span)) {
    tokenTracking.trackToken("network-optimize-responsive");

    // Simplified responsive behavior - use fewer breakpoints
    const optimizedSpan = {
      // Use xs and md only to simplify layout calculations
      xs: span.xs || span.sm || 12, // Default to full width on mobile
      md: span.md || span.lg || span.xl, // Take the largest size for desktop
    };

    return (
      <MantineGrid.Col
        ref={ref}
        span={optimizedSpan}
        className={`${className} grid-col-network-optimized`}
        {...props}
      >
        {children}
      </MantineGrid.Col>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Container Component Optimizations

The Container component adapts size and padding based on network conditions:

```tsx
// For poor network, use smaller container to reduce layout calculations
const shouldOptimizeSize = networkAware && (isDataSaver || quality === "poor");

switch (size) {
  case "md":
    return shouldOptimizeSize
      ? "var(--container-size-sm, 768px)" // Optimize by using smaller container
      : "var(--container-size-md, 992px)"; // Normal size for good connections
  case "lg":
    return shouldOptimizeSize
      ? "var(--container-size-md, 992px)" // Optimize by using smaller container
      : "var(--container-size-lg, 1200px)"; // Normal size for good connections
  // ...other sizes
}

// Apply responsive padding with network-aware optimizations
const getDefaultPadding = (): string => {
  const shouldOptimizePadding =
    networkAware && (isDataSaver || quality === "poor");

  if (shouldOptimizePadding) {
    tokenTracking.trackToken("network-optimize-padding");
    return size === "xs" || size === "sm"
      ? getSpacingValue("sm") // Smaller padding
      : getSpacingValue("md"); // Smaller padding
  }

  // Normal padding for good connections
  return size === "xs" || size === "sm"
    ? getSpacingValue("md")
    : getSpacingValue("lg");
};
```

### 6. Connection Quality Hook

The `useConnectionQuality` hook provides detailed network information:

```typescript
const {
  quality, // 'high', 'medium', 'low', or 'poor'
  isDataSaver, // Whether data saver mode is enabled
  isMetered, // Whether connection is pay-per-use
  downlinkSpeed, // Raw download speed
  rtt, // Round-trip time
  effectiveType, // Connection type ('4g', '3g', etc.)
} = useConnectionQuality();
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Network Condition Detection

We use multiple signals to detect network conditions, prioritizing those most relevant to South African users:

1. **RTT (Round Trip Time)**: High priority, as latency is often the limiting factor in SA
2. **Connection Type**: Used as a baseline indicator
3. **Downlink Speed**: Used as a secondary indicator
4. **Data Saver Mode**: Automatically treated as 'poor' connection
5. **Motion Preferences**: User preferences are respected

### Component Adaptation

Components adapt in the following ways:

1. **Animation Complexity**: Reduced animation complexity (simpler transitions, fewer simultaneous animations)
2. **Animation Duration**: Shorter animations to improve perceived performance
3. **Visual Complexity**: Simplified visuals (e.g., removing shadows, reducing border radius)
4. **Typography**: Smaller headings, system fonts instead of custom fonts
5. **Layout**: Simplified layouts with fewer decorative elements

## Testing

We've implemented specific tests for South African network conditions:

```typescript
test("prioritizes high RTT for South African conditions", () => {
  mockConnection({
    effectiveType: "4g", // Fast connection type
    downlink: 10, // Good bandwidth
    rtt: 650, // But very high latency (common in rural SA)
  });

  const { result } = renderHook(() => useConnectionQuality());

  // Despite good bandwidth, high RTT should make this poor quality
  expect(result.current.quality).toBe("poor");
});
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Enable Network Awareness**: Use the `networkAware` prop on components
2. **Test with Connection Throttling**: Test UI under various network conditions
3. **Consider Data Costs**: Optimize asset loading and reduce unnecessary animations
4. **Provide Fallbacks**: Always provide graceful fallbacks for poor connections
5. **Respect User Preferences**: Honor Data Saver mode and reduced motion preferences

## Testing and Validation

We've implemented a comprehensive testing suite for network-aware components:

```tsx
// Mock data saver mode
Object.defineProperty(navigator, "connection", {
  value: {
    saveData: true,
  },
  configurable: true,
});

// Test container optimization
const { container } = renderWithProviders(
  <Container size="lg" networkAware={true}>
    <div>Data Saver Container</div>
  </Container>,
);

// Verify container was optimized
expect(container.firstChild).toHaveAttribute("data-network-quality");
```

By implementing these optimizations, Fluxori UI components provide a responsive, efficient experience for users across South Africa's diverse network landscape, ensuring the application performs well even in challenging connectivity environments.
