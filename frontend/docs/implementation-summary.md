## South African Market Optimizations

The following optimizations have been implemented specifically for the South African market:

### 1. Network-Aware Components

All components now adapt to network conditions automatically:

- Reduced animation complexity on poor connections
- Simplified layouts on slow connections
- Support for data saver mode
- Specialized behaviors for high-latency connections common in South Africa

### 2. Typography Optimizations

- Reduced font sizes on poor connections
- Simplified typography on slow networks
- Removal of non-essential text in data saver mode

### 3. Connection Quality Detection

- Optimized thresholds for South African networks
- RTT-based detection for high-latency connections
- Data saver mode detection and response

### 4. Critical UI Preservation

- Error animations remain even on poor connections (with reduced intensity)
- Error messages always displayed regardless of connection quality
- Focus states maintained for accessibility
