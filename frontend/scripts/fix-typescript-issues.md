# TypeScript Issue Fixing Guide

This guide outlines how TypeScript errors were fixed in the Fluxori frontend.

## Current Status

**Status Update (April 17, 2025):** All TypeScript errors have been resolved. The frontend codebase is now completely TypeScript compliant, with proper type definitions throughout the system. This includes:

- Full typing for all UI components
- Proper type definitions for API clients and responses
- Type-safe Chart.js configurations
- Complete type safety for network-aware components
- Proper typing for South African market optimization features

## Overview of Previously Fixed Issues

The main TypeScript errors in the codebase that have now been resolved fell into these categories:

1. **UI Component Prop Type Mismatches (≈80% of errors)**
   - Properties missing from Mantine component types
   - Incompatible prop types between old and new Mantine versions

2. **API Client Type Issues (≈10% of errors)**
   - Missing parameter types
   - API response type assertions

3. **Chart.js Configuration Type Issues (≈5% of errors)**
   - Incompatible animation configuration
   - Unknown properties in tooltip options

4. **Other Miscellaneous Issues (≈5% of errors)**
   - Missing module exports
   - Type guard issues

## Fixing Strategy

### 1. Use Custom UI Component Wrappers

We've created wrapper components in `src/components/ui/` that provide backward compatibility with Mantine's older API while using the newer version underneath.

Run the component import fixer script:

```bash
node scripts/fix-component-imports.js
```

This script updates imports across the codebase to use our custom UI components instead of Mantine's directly.

### 2. Fix API Client Type Issues

1. Use proper type definitions for API parameters and responses
2. Add type assertions where needed
3. Create interfaces for API request/response shapes

### 3. Fix Chart.js Configuration

1. Use proper type casting for chart animations
2. Remove unsupported properties like `animationDuration`
3. Use standard chart.js configuration options

### 4. Rebuild Approach vs. Incremental Fixes

Since we're in early development, we can take a more aggressive rebuild approach:

1. Start with the foundational components and types
2. Replace problematic component usage with properly typed alternatives
3. Use type assertions judiciously where needed
4. Run TypeScript checks frequently to track progress

## Manual Fixes for Remaining Issues

For any issues that remain after running the scripts:

1. **Type Assertions**: Use `as` assertions when TypeScript can't infer types correctly
2. **Update Component Usage**: Replace problematic props with alternatives
3. **Fix Chart.js Code**: Update chart configuration to match chart.js types
4. **Update keyframes usage**: Replace the deprecated keyframes import

## Testing the Fixes

After making changes, always run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Keep track of error counts to ensure progress is being made.
