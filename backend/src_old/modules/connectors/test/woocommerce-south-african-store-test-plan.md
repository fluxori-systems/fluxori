# Comprehensive Testing Plan for South African WooCommerce Stores

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for validating the WooCommerce connector with real South African WooCommerce stores. The testing aims to verify all implemented features under actual South African network conditions and validate specific optimizations for the region.

## Test Environments

### Production WooCommerce Stores

- **Test Store 1**: Cape Town-based store (Western Cape)

  - WooCommerce v7.8+
  - High-volume store with 1000+ products
  - Multiple warehouses (Cape Town, Johannesburg)

- **Test Store 2**: Johannesburg-based store (Gauteng)

  - WooCommerce v7.5+
  - Medium-volume store with 300-500 products
  - Single warehouse with nationwide shipping

- **Test Store 3**: Durban-based store (KwaZulu-Natal)
  - WooCommerce v7.0+
  - Small-volume store with 100-200 products
  - Rural delivery capabilities

### Network Conditions to Test

- Standard fiber connection (100+ Mbps)
- Mobile data connection (3G/4G/LTE)
- Poor connectivity areas (rural connections)
- During load shedding periods (scheduled power outages)
- High-latency conditions (simulate with network throttling)
