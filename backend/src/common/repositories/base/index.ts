/**
 * Repository Base Utilities Public API
 *
 * This file defines the internal public interface of the Repository base utilities.
 * These utilities should generally not be used directly by application code, but
 * rather through the main repository implementations.
 * 
 * For repository implementations, use the repository-exports.ts file instead,
 * which provides a more comprehensive set of exports with documentation.

// Re-export all types and utilities from the central exports file
export * from './repository-exports';
