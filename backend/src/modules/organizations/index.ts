/**
 * Organizations Module Public API

 * This file defines the public interface of the Organizations module, exporting only what should be

 * internal components.

// Re-export module
export { OrganizationsModule } from "./organizations.module";

// Note: This module is currently a stub without implementing services, controllers, or schemas.
// As the module is developed, exports should be added here to expose the public API.
