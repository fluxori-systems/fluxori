## Implementation Priority

1. Unit tests for core functionality (authentication, data mapping)
2. Integration tests with WooCommerce sandbox
3. South African network optimizations tests
4. Multi-tenant isolation tests
5. Performance and load testing
6. Comprehensive end-to-end tests

## Tools and Frameworks
