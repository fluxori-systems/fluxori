 # Node.js 22 Upgrade Rollout Plan

 This document outlines the strategy, timeline, and steps required to safely upgrade the Fluxori codebase (backend and frontend) from Node.js 20 to Node.js 22.

 ## 1. Purpose
 Ensure a smooth transition to Node.js 22 with minimal disruption, full test coverage, and rollback capability in case of unexpected issues.

 ## 2. Scope
 - Backend (`/backend` NestJS API)
 - Frontend (`/frontend` Next.js app)
 - Dockerfiles and CI/CD configurations
 - Developer local environments

 ## 3. Prerequisites
 - Update `nvm`, `nvmrc`, or developer documentation to include Node.js 22.
 - Verify all team members have access to Node.js 22 via `nvm install 22`.
 - Ensure CI runners support Node.js 22 images.
 - Backup current Docker images and deployment configurations.

 ## 4. Phase 1: Development Validation
 1. **Branch:** Create feature branch `chore/upgrade-node-22`.
 2. **Dockerfile Update:**
    - Change `FROM node:20-alpine` → `FROM node:22-alpine` in both `backend/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile`.
 3. **Typings Update:** Bump `@types/node` to `^22` in devDependencies where applicable.
 4. **Polyfills Cleanup:** Remove any fetch/crypto polyfills guarded by Node.js version checks.
 5. **Local Testing:**
    - `nvm use 22`
    - `npm ci && npm run build && npm test` in both backend and frontend.
    - Manual smoke tests (API health, UI load).
 6. **Commit & Push:** Open a pull request for review.

 ## 5. Phase 2: Staging Deployment
 1. **Deploy to staging:** Build Docker images on Node.js 22, deploy to staging cluster.
 2. **End-to-End Tests:** Run full integration tests (E2E, Cypress).
 3. **Performance Benchmark:** Measure response times, memory usage, and resource consumption; compare to Node.js 20 baseline.
 4. **Security Scans:** Re-run dependency and vulnerability scans.
 5. **Approval Gate:** Product and Engineering sign-off for production rollout.

 ## 6. Phase 3: Production Rollout
 1. **Blue/Green or Canary Deploy:** Deploy Node.js 22 containers alongside Node.js 20; route a small percentage of traffic.
 2. **Monitor Metrics:** Health endpoints, error rates, latency, memory usage.
 3. **Full Traffic Cutover:** After 1–2 hours of stable metrics, switch all traffic to Node.js 22.
 4. **Post-Deployment Verification:** Run smoke tests and check logs for anomalies.

 ## 7. Testing & Validation Checklist
 - [ ] Unit tests pass on Node.js 22
 - [ ] Integration and E2E tests pass
 - [ ] Linting and type checks
 - [ ] Docker image builds without errors
 - [ ] API health endpoint returns HTTP 200
 - [ ] UI loads without console errors

 ## 8. Rollback Strategy
 - Revert Kubernetes/Cloud Run service to previous Node.js 20 image tag.
 - Roll back Docker Compose or Helm release.
 - Monitor for recovery and close the incident.

 ## 9. Timeline & Communication
 | Phase                  | Duration  | Owner         | Communication              |
 |------------------------|-----------|---------------|----------------------------|
 | Dev Validation         | 2 days    | Backend/Frontend Engineers | Slack #dev, PR comments  |
 | Staging Testing        | 1 day     | QA Team       | Email + Slack #release     |
 | Production Rollout     | 1 day     | DevOps Team   | Incident channel + Standup |

 ## 10. Risks & Mitigations
 - **Dependency failures:** Pin known‑good versions; update failing deps.
 - **Performance regressions:** Closely monitor and have rollback ready.
 - **CI interruptions:** Stagger rollout; run on isolated runners first.
