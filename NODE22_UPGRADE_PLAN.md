 # Node.js 22 Upgrade Rollout Plan

 This document outlines the strategy, timeline, and steps required to safely upgrade the Fluxori codebase (backend and frontend) from Node.js 20 to Node.js 22.

 ## 1. Purpose
 Ensure a smooth transition to Node.js 22 with minimal disruption, full test coverage, and rollback capability in case of unexpected issues.

 ## 2. Scope
 - Backend (`/backend` NestJS API)
 - Frontend (`/frontend` Next.js app)
 - Dockerfiles and CI/CD configurations
 - Developer local environments

 ## 3. Prerequisites
 - Update `nvm`, `nvmrc`, or developer documentation to include Node.js 22.
 - Verify all team members have access to Node.js 22 via `nvm install 22`.
 - Ensure CI runners support Node.js 22 images.
 - Backup current Docker images and deployment configurations.

 ## 4. Phase 1: Development Validation
 1. **Branch:** Create feature branch `chore/upgrade-node-22`.
 2. **Dockerfile Update:**
    - Change `FROM node:20-alpine` → `FROM node:22-alpine` in both `backend/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile`.
 3. **Typings Update:** Bump `@types/node` to `^22` in devDependencies where applicable.
 4. **Polyfills Cleanup:** Remove any fetch/crypto polyfills guarded by Node.js version checks.
 5. **Local Testing:**
    - `nvm use 22`
    - `npm ci && npm run build && npm test` in both backend and frontend.
    - Manual smoke tests (API health, UI load).
 6. **Commit & Push:** Open a pull request for review.

    ## 5. Phase 2: CI Pipeline Validation
    1. **CI Builds:** Ensure CI uses Node.js 22 for build and test steps.
    2. **Automated Tests:** Run unit, integration, and E2E tests under Node.js 22 in CI.
    3. **Lint & Type Checks:** Verify linting and typechecking pass in CI.
    4. **Container Build:** Build backend/frontend Docker images with `node:22-alpine` in CI.
    5. **Dependency Audit:** Re-run vulnerability scans and dependency checks.

    ## 6. Phase 3: Merge & Monitor (Dev Environment)
    1. **Merge Changes:** After CI validation, merge `chore/upgrade-node-22` into `main`.
    2. **Dev Deploy:** Pull latest `main`, build and run locally or in a development environment.
    3. **Smoke Tests:** Execute manual smoke tests and validate core functionality.
    4. **Issue Monitoring:** Observe CI notifications and local logs for regressions.

 ## 7. Testing & Validation Checklist
 - [ ] Unit tests pass on Node.js 22
 - [ ] Integration and E2E tests pass
 - [ ] Linting and type checks
 - [ ] Docker image builds without errors
 - [ ] API health endpoint returns HTTP 200
 - [ ] UI loads without console errors

 ## 8. Rollback Strategy
 - Revert Kubernetes/Cloud Run service to previous Node.js 20 image tag.
 - Roll back Docker Compose or Helm release.
 - Monitor for recovery and close the incident.

 ## 9. Timeline & Communication
 | Phase                  | Duration  | Owner         | Communication              |
 |------------------------|-----------|---------------|----------------------------|
    | Dev Validation         | 1 day     | Engineers     | Slack #dev, PR comments    |
    | CI Pipeline Validation | 1 day     | Engineers/CI  | CI status, logs            |
    | Merge & Monitor        | 0.5 day   | Engineers     | Slack #dev, CI alerts      |

 ## 10. Risks & Mitigations
 - **Dependency failures:** Pin known‑good versions; update failing deps.
 - **Performance regressions:** Closely monitor and have rollback ready.
 - **CI interruptions:** Stagger rollout; run on isolated runners first.
