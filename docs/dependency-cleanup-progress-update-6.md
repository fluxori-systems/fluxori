# Dependency Cleanup Progress Update #6

## Repository Refactoring Progress

During this session, we continued implementing the Repository Refactoring portion of the Dependency Issue Remediation Plan. We focused on updating repositories in the rag-retrieval and ai-insights modules.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Updated RAG-Retrieval Module Repositories**:

   - Fixed imports in DocumentRepository to use the public API
   - Fixed imports in EmbeddingProviderRepository to use the public API
   - Both repositories were already using FirestoreBaseRepository correctly

2. **Updated AI-Insights Module Repositories**:

   - Fixed imports in AIModelConfigRepository to use the public API
   - Fixed imports in InsightRepository to use the public API
   - Fixed deprecated method usage (`withTransaction` → `runTransaction`) in AIModelConfigRepository

3. **Fixed Utility Module References**:

   - Updated `/common/repositories/utils.ts` to import FirestoreBaseRepository instead of the deprecated UnifiedFirestoreRepository

4. **Verified Module Migration Status**:
   - Confirmed that all repositories in marketplaces and users modules are already correctly implemented

### Current Status Summary

Modules that have been fully migrated and verified:

- feature-flags ✅
- inventory ✅
- buybox ✅
- agent-framework ✅
- rag-retrieval ✅
- ai-insights ✅
- marketplaces ✅
- users ✅

The following modules still may need verification:

- storage
- notifications
- scheduled-tasks
- international-trade
- order-ingestion
- organizations

### Next Steps

1. Verify remaining modules for repository implementation correctness
2. Update any services that might be affected by repository changes
3. Run comprehensive tests to ensure the refactoring doesn't break functionality
4. Update documentation to reflect the new repository pattern
5. Create an internal developer guide for proper repository usage

## Overall Dependency Management Progress

We've made excellent progress on the repository refactoring aspect of the Dependency Issue Remediation Plan. Most of the critical modules have been updated to use the proper repository pattern and import from the public API.

The remaining work is primarily focused on verification and cleanup rather than major refactoring, as we've addressed most of the high-priority modules. We've systematically fixed direct imports and deprecated method usage throughout the codebase.

In the next session, we'll finish verifying the remaining modules and begin implementing the internal developer guide for repository usage patterns.
