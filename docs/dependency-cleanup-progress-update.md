# Dependency Cleanup Progress Update

## Progress Since Last Report

### 1. Extended Public API Coverage

✅ Created additional module public APIs:
- `ai-insights` module: Added new index.ts with comprehensive exports
- `common/auth`: Created a new common utility module for auth operations
- `common/repositories/utils.ts`: Added repository utility functions

### 2. Standardized Auth Access Pattern

✅ Implemented a standardized auth access pattern:
- Created `common/auth/index.ts` that re-exports auth components
- Added utility functions for common auth operations
- Defined a standard `DecodedFirebaseToken` interface
- Implemented helper methods like `isAdmin`, `isInOrganization`, `isOwner`

### 3. Improved Repository Access Patterns

✅ Enhanced repository utilities and patterns:
- Added helper functions for creating query filters
- Implemented standard pagination query options
- Created organization and soft-delete filter utilities
- Added standard repository options

### 4. Updated Controllers to Use Common Patterns

✅ Refactored controllers to use the new common patterns:
- Updated `feature-flags` controller to use `common/auth`
- Improved `agent-framework` controller to use auth utilities
- Removed redundant interfaces in favor of common definitions
- Implemented standardized auth checks

## Key Improvements

1. **Authentication Pattern Standardization**
   - All modules can now use `import { ... } from 'src/common/auth'`
   - Consistent token typing with `DecodedFirebaseToken`
   - Common auth check utilities for permissions and ownership

2. **Repository Pattern Enhancements**
   - Helper functions for common query patterns
   - Standard options for repository configuration
   - Improved repository access through public API

3. **Dependency Boundary Enforcement**
   - Reduced direct cross-module dependencies
   - Improved module isolation through proper public APIs
   - Fixed high-priority violations in key modules

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining High-Priority Modules**
   - Create/update public APIs for inventory and marketplaces modules
   - Fix remaining auth dependencies in feature-flags module
   - Update agent-framework service to use proper feature-flag imports

2. **Implement CI/CD Integration**
   - Add pre-commit hooks for dependency validation
   - Configure GitHub workflow for comprehensive validation
   - Set up visualization artifact generation

3. **Expand Common Patterns**
   - Create utility patterns for configuration access
   - Implement standard error handling patterns
   - Add common validation utilities

4. **Documentation**
   - Update module documentation for newly refactored modules
   - Create developer guidelines for new patterns
   - Add examples of correct dependency usage
