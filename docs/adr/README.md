# Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Fluxori project. Each ADR documents a significant architectural decision, including context, consequences, and dependency visualizations.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs are used to document and communicate the rationale behind architectural decisions.

## Fluxori ADR Process

The Fluxori ADR process integrates dependency visualization to enhance architectural understanding:

1. **Identification**: Identify an architectural decision that needs to be documented
2. **Analysis**: Analyze the context, options, and consequences
3. **Dependency Visualization**: Generate visualizations of affected module dependencies
4. **Documentation**: Document the decision using the ADR template
5. **Review**: Review the ADR with stakeholders
6. **Decision**: Accept, modify, or reject the proposal
7. **Implementation**: Implement the decision in code
8. **Maintenance**: Update the ADR as needed when circumstances change

## ADR Structure

Each ADR in the Fluxori project includes the following sections:

- **Title**: A descriptive title of the architectural decision
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded)
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The forces at play, including technological, political, and project-specific concerns
- **Decision**: The decision that was made
- **Module Dependencies**: Visualizations of module dependencies affected by this decision
- **Boundary Rules**: Rules that must be enforced to maintain the architecture
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision
- **Compliance Validation**: How compliance with the decision will be validated
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered
- **Related Decisions**: Links to related ADRs or documentation

## Dependency Visualization

A key feature of Fluxori ADRs is the integration of dependency visualizations:

- Each ADR includes visualizations of affected module dependencies
- Visualizations are generated automatically using dependency-cruiser
- Dependency violations are highlighted in the visualizations
- Visualizations are updated when the codebase changes

## Creating a New ADR

To create a new ADR:

```bash
cd scripts/adr
./adr.sh create --title="Your Decision Title" --modules=module1,module2
```

This will:
1. Create a new ADR file with the next available number
2. Generate dependency visualizations for the specified modules
3. Update the ADR index
