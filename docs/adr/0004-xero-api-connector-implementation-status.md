## Known Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits** - Currently operating within Xero's standard tier limits (1,000 calls/day). Premium tier upgrade planned for high-volume clients.

2. **OAuth Refresh** - Users need to re-authenticate every 60 days due to Xero's refresh token expiration policy.

3. **Webhook Limitations** - Xero doesn't support webhooks for all entity types; polling is still required for some operations.

4. **Bulk Operations** - Some operations cannot be efficiently batched due to Xero API limitations.

## Monitoring and Operations

The connector is monitored via:

1. **Health Dashboard** - Real-time status of Xero API connectivity
2. **Rate Limit Metrics** - Daily and per-minute quota consumption
3. **Circuit Breaker Status** - Open/closed state monitoring
4. **Cache Performance** - Hit rates and invalidation events
5. **Error Tracking** - Classification and trending of API errors

## Next Steps

While the implementation is complete, the following enhancements are planned:

1. **Q2 2025**: Enhanced webhook integration as Xero expands supported event types
2. **Q3 2025**: AI-assisted reconciliation features
3. **Q4 2025**: Expanded South African payment gateway integrations
4. **Q1 2026**: Adaptation for scheduled VAT rate change to 15.5%

## Conclusion

The Xero API Connector has been successfully implemented with all planned features and South African optimizations. It provides a robust financial integration solution for the Fluxori platform, with special adaptations for the South African market conditions. The implementation exceeds performance targets and provides excellent resilience against local challenges like load shedding and network instability.
