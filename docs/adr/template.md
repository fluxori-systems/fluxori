# ADR-000: Title of Architecture Decision

## Status

<!-- Status of the decision. Can be: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded -->

Proposed

## Date

<!-- Date of the decision in YYYY-MM-DD format -->

YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

<!--
Describe the context and problem statement. Include any relevant constraints or requirements.
This section should explain:
- The forces at play, including technological, political, social, project-specific, etc.
- The reasons that a decision was necessary
- The background information that influenced the decision
-->

## Decision

<!--
Describe the decision that was made:
- The architectural solution chosen
- The rationale behind the decision
- The approach and principles adopted
- Consider including code snippets that show implementation
-->

## Module Dependencies

<!--
This section should include visualizations of the dependencies related to this decision.
The visualizations should be automatically generated using dependency-cruiser.

Each visualization should be accompanied by:
- A description of what the diagram shows
- Key insights about the dependency relationships
- Any issues or concerns with the current structure
-->

### Current Module Structure

<!--
Include the current dependency visualization, focused on the modules relevant to this decision.
Example:
![Current Module Dependencies](../analysis/current-dependencies-XXXX.svg)
-->

### Proposed Module Structure

<!--
If the decision changes the dependency structure, include a visualization of the proposed structure.
Example:
![Proposed Module Dependencies](../analysis/proposed-dependencies-XXXX.svg)
-->

## Boundary Rules

<!--
Describe the boundary rules that need to be enforced:
- Which modules should only be accessed through their public APIs
- Which direct dependencies between modules are allowed/forbidden
- Any exceptions to the general rules
-->

```javascript
// Sample enforcement rules in dependency-cruiser format
{
  name: "module-boundary-rule",
  severity: "error",
  comment: "Description of the boundary rule",
  from: {
    path: "^src/modules/module-a/"
  },
  to: {
    path: "^src/modules/module-b/",
    pathNot: [
      "^src/modules/module-b/index.ts$" // Only allow access via public API
    ]
  }
}
```

## Consequences

<!--
Describe the resulting context after applying the decision:
- The impact on the system architecture
- Positive, negative, and neutral consequences
- Any new risks introduced
- Any technical debt created or resolved
-->

## Compliance Validation

<!--
Describe how compliance with this decision will be validated:
- ESLint rules
- Dependency-cruiser configurations
- CI/CD checks
- Code review guidelines
-->

## Alternatives Considered

<!--
Describe the alternatives that were considered:
- Other architectural approaches
- Different module structures
- The pros and cons of each alternative
- Why the chosen decision is better than the alternatives
-->
