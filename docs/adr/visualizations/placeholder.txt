This is a placeholder file for the visualizations directory.
In a real implementation, this directory would contain SVG files and metadata for ADR visualizations generated using the scripts in /scripts/adr/.

The visualizations would be generated using dependency-cruiser and would show module dependencies relevant to each ADR.

Examples of visualization files that would be generated:
- adr-001-module-boundary-enforcement.svg
- adr-001-module-boundary-enforcement.txt
- adr-002-repository-pattern-implementation.svg
- adr-002-repository-pattern-implementation.txt
