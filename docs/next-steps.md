# Dependency Management: Next Steps

## Immediate Next Actions

1. **Complete Module Interface Analysis**

   ```bash
   # Run the module interface analysis script
   cd /home/tarquin_stapa/fluxori
   node scripts/analyze-module-interfaces.js
   ```

   This will generate a comprehensive report of all module interfaces, showing:

   - Which modules have proper public APIs
   - Which modules have incomplete public APIs
   - Which modules are missing public APIs entirely

2. **Create Full Dependency Visualization**

   ```bash
   # Generate comprehensive dependency visualizations
   cd /home/tarquin_stapa/fluxori
   npm run deps:graph
   ```

   This will create SVG files showing dependency relationships for:

   - Backend module dependencies
   - Frontend component dependencies
   - Overall architecture

3. **Analyze and Document Boundary Violations**

   ```bash
   # Generate detailed boundary violation report
   cd /home/tarquin_stapa/fluxori/backend
   npx dependency-cruiser src --validate > ../docs/analysis/all-violations.txt
   ```

   Review this report to identify patterns of violations across modules.

## Phase 1 Tasks (Next 1-2 Weeks)

1. **Update High-Priority Module Interfaces**

   - Create or update index.ts files for:
     - Agent Framework Module
     - Feature Flags Module
     - Auth Module
     - Common Repositories
   - Follow the standard template pattern
   - Ensure all public components are properly exported

2. **Document Dependency Patterns**

   - Create documentation on proper inter-module dependency patterns
   - Define how modules should communicate with each other
   - Establish guidelines for dependency management

3. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Implement regular dependency checks in development workflow
   - Create dashboards for tracking architectural compliance
   - Set up alerts for new boundary violations

## Team Communication

1. **Schedule Architecture Review**

   - Present findings from dependency analysis
   - Review proposed refactoring approach
   - Get buy-in from team on prioritization

2. **Create Developer Guidelines**

   - Document proper module interaction patterns
   - Create examples of correct vs. incorrect dependencies
   - Add to onboarding materials

3. **Add to Sprint Planning**
   - Include high-priority refactoring tasks in upcoming sprint
   - Allocate time for technical debt reduction
   - Include metrics for tracking progress

## Task Assignment Recommendations

1. **Architecture Team**

   - Complete dependency analysis
   - Define standard patterns
   - Create documentation

2. **Module Owners**

   - Update their module's public interfaces
   - Fix boundary violations in their code
   - Write module-specific documentation

3. **DevOps Team**
   - Set up CI/CD integration
   - Implement monitoring
   - Track compliance metrics
