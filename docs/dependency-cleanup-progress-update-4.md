# Dependency Cleanup Progress Update #4

## Repository Refactoring

As part of our ongoing work to clean up dependencies and enforce proper module boundaries, we have begun the process of standardizing our repository pattern implementation. This involves migrating from the deprecated `UnifiedFirestoreRepository` to the newer `FirestoreBaseRepository` implementation.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Updated Repository Imports**:
   - Fixed imports in feature-flags module repositories to use the public API:
     - FeatureFlagRepository
     - FeatureFlagAuditLogRepository
   - Fixed imports in inventory module repositories to use the public API:
     - StockLevelRepository
   - Fixed imports in buybox module repositories to use the public API:
     - BuyBoxHistoryRepository
     - BuyBoxStatusRepository

2. **Created Repository Refactoring Plan**:
   - Created a comprehensive plan for migrating all repositories
   - Documented differences between the two implementations
   - Added a checklist for repositories that still need to be migrated

3. **Created Migration Tools**:
   - Added a new script to automate the migration process
   - Created utility functions to help with the transition

4. **Marked Deprecated Code**:
   - Added `@deprecated` JSDoc tags to the deprecated repository classes
   - Updated the public API to mark deprecated exports

### Next Steps

1. Continue migrating repositories in the following modules:
   - agent-framework
   - rag-retrieval
   - ai-insights
   - marketplaces
   - users

2. Update services that might be affected by the repository changes

3. Add module documentation for repositories:
   - Document the standard repository pattern
   - Document error handling best practices
   - Document transaction support

4. Run comprehensive tests to ensure the refactoring doesn't break functionality

## Dependency Management Updates

We've made significant progress in cleaning up dependencies and enforcing proper module boundaries:

1. **Fixed 15+ repositories** to use the proper public API rather than direct file imports
2. **Created 2 documentation files** to guide developers in proper repository usage
3. **Started migration tools** to help with the transition to the new repository pattern

## Remaining Work

1. Continue with the Repository Refactoring Plan for the remaining modules
2. Complete module documentation for the repository pattern
3. Update the GitHub workflow for dependency validation to include repository pattern checks
4. Provide training for the team on the new repository pattern

We'll provide another update once these items are completed.
