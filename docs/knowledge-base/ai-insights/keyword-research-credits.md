# Keyword Research Credits

## Introduction

The Fluxori platform's Keyword Research feature uses a credit-based system to power advanced AI-driven marketplace research capabilities. This document explains how the credit system works, what you can do with your credits, and how to get the most value from them.

## How Credits Work

### Credit Allocation

Each account receives credits based on your subscription plan:

- **Free Tier**: 100 credits/month
- **Standard Tier**: 500 credits/month
- **Professional Tier**: 1,500 credits/month
- **Enterprise Tier**: Custom allocation

Credits reset on the first day of each billing cycle. Unused credits do not roll over to the next month.

### Credit Usage

Different operations consume different amounts of credits:

| Operation                 | Credits | Description                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Basic Keyword Search      | 5-10    | Single keyword research across one marketplace         |
| Multi-Marketplace Search  | 15-30   | Search across multiple South African marketplaces      |
