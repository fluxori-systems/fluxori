### Why does Fluxori use a credit system?

The credit system allows us to:
1. Provide transparent pricing for AI features
2. Give you control over your AI usage and costs
3. Ensure fair distribution of compute resources
4. Allow different pricing tiers based on usage needs

### How many credits do different AI features use?

Credit consumption varies by feature:

| Feature | Credits per Use | Description |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Daily Market Trend Report | 50 | Comprehensive analysis of market trends relevant to your products |
| Product Pricing Recommendation | 15 | AI-generated optimal price point for a single product |
| Inventory Restock Prediction | 25 | When and how much to restock for a product |
| Bulk Pricing Optimization | 100 | Optimize pricing for your entire catalog |

## Special Considerations for South African Users

### Are AI credit prices affected by exchange rates?

No, we price AI credits in South African Rand (ZAR) for South African customers to avoid exchange rate fluctuations.

### Do AI features use local South African data?

Yes, our AI models are trained with significant South African e-commerce data to ensure relevant insights for the local market, especially for platforms like Takealot, Bob Shop, and other regional marketplaces.

### Where are the AI services hosted?

Our AI services are hosted in the europe-west4 (Netherlands) region, which provides the best combination of performance and cost for South African users, as the africa-south1 (Johannesburg) region does not yet support all GCP AI services.
