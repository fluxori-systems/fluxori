# Competitor Alerts System

The Competitor Alerts System automatically monitors marketplace keywords and products, alerting you to important changes in pricing, rankings, availability, and more.

## Overview

Our Competitor Alerts System continuously tracks your specified keywords and products across South African marketplaces, detecting changes that may affect your business, such as:

- Price changes by competitors
- Ranking improvements or drops
- New competitors entering the market
- Stock status changes
- Special promotions
- Product description/title changes

## How the Alert System Works

1. **Set up watches**: Create watches for specific keywords, products, or marketplaces
2. **Configure alert triggers**: Choose what types of changes should trigger alerts
3. **Set thresholds**: Define how significant a change must be to generate an alert
4. **Scheduled monitoring**: The system regularly checks for changes based on your configuration
5. **Alert generation**: When changes exceed your thresholds, alerts are generated
6. **Notification delivery**: Receive alerts via email, in-app notifications, or both

## Using the Credit System with Competitor Alerts

Competitor alerts utilize the credit system just like other AI insights. Here's how credits work with alerts:

### Credit Usage

- **Watch Creation**: Setting up a watch costs 1 credit per keyword/marketplace combination
- **Monitoring Frequency**: Credits are charged based on monitoring frequency
  - Daily monitoring: 5 credits per month per watch
  - Weekly monitoring: 2 credits per month per watch
  - Monthly monitoring: 1 credit per month per watch
- **Advanced Alert Types**: Some advanced alert types may require additional credits
  - Sentiment tracking: +2 credits per month
  - Full product comparison: +3 credits per month

### Credit Optimization Tips

1. **Focus on High-Value Keywords**: Monitor only your most important keywords
2. **Adjust Monitoring Frequency**: Use daily monitoring for critical products, weekly or monthly for less important ones
3. **Set Appropriate Thresholds**: Too low thresholds mean more alerts and more credit usage
4. **Use Watch Groups**: Group similar products/keywords to share monitoring resources
5. **Utilize Alert Summaries**: Get daily/weekly summaries instead of instant alerts to reduce credit usage

A: The number of watches depends on your subscription tier. Basic accounts can have up to 10 active watches, while Premium accounts have unlimited watches.
