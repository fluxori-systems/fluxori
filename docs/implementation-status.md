   ```

4. **Begin Module Prioritization**
   ```bash
   # Create prioritization document with template
   cat > /home/tarquin_stapa/fluxori/docs/analysis/module-priorities.md << EOF
   # Module Refactoring Priorities
   
   ## High Priority
   - Agent Framework Module - Used by many other modules
   - Feature Flags Module - Foundation for feature toggling
   
   ## Medium Priority
   
   ## Low Priority
   
   ## Dependencies Between Modules
