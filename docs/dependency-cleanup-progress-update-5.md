# Dependency Cleanup Progress Update #5

## Repository Refactoring Progress

During this session, we made significant progress on the Repository Refactoring part of the Dependency Issue Remediation Plan.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Updated Agent Framework Module Repositories**:

   - Migrated AgentConfigRepository, AgentConversationRepository, and ModelRegistryRepository to FirestoreBaseRepository
   - Updated import statements to use the public API

2. **Updated Inventory Module Repositories**:

   - Migrated ProductRepository, WarehouseRepository, and StockMovementRepository to FirestoreBaseRepository
   - Updated import statements to use the public API

3. **Fixed More Direct Import Issues**:
   - Replaced direct imports from `/common/repositories/unified-firestore.repository` with the public API imports
   - Improved consistency of imports across the codebase

### Progress Summary

We've now completed refactoring the following modules:

- feature-flags ✅
- inventory ✅
- buybox ✅
- agent-framework ✅

The following modules still need to be refactored:

- rag-retrieval
- ai-insights
- marketplaces
- users
- storage
- notifications
- scheduled-tasks
- international-trade
- order-ingestion
- organizations

### Next Steps

1. Complete repository refactoring for the remaining modules
2. Update any services that might be affected by the repository changes
3. Run comprehensive tests to ensure the refactoring doesn't break functionality
4. Update documentation to reflect the new repository pattern

## Overall Dependency Management Progress

Our implementation of the Dependency Issue Remediation Plan is proceeding well. We've made significant progress in enforcing proper module boundaries and establishing consistent patterns for repository implementations.

The repository refactoring has been a major focus of this session, as it addresses one of the most common causes of improper cross-module dependencies. By standardizing on FirestoreBaseRepository and ensuring all modules import from the public API, we're creating a more maintainable codebase with clearer boundaries.

In the next session, we'll continue working on the remaining modules to complete the repository refactoring phase of the plan.
