## Usage Guide

### Accessing Analytics

1. Navigate to the PIM module in the dashboard
2. Select the "Analytics" tab from the main navigation
3. Choose a report type from the dropdown menu
4. Adjust time period if applicable
5. Use the refresh button to update data

### Exporting Reports

1. Standard export:
   - Select the desired report
   - Click the "Export" dropdown
   - Choose the desired format (CSV, Excel, PDF, JSON)
   - The report will download automatically

2. Network-resilient export (for poor connectivity):
   - Select the desired report
   - Click the "Network-resilient Export" option
   - The system will automatically optimize the export based on current conditions
   - For critical load shedding (Stage 4+), the report is queued for later delivery by email

3. Report bundling (for multiple reports):
   - Select multiple reports using the checkboxes
   - Click "Export Bundle"
   - Choose the format for all reports
   - The system will package all reports efficiently and provide a single download

4. Scheduled reports:
   - Click the "Schedule" button on any report
   - Select frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Add email recipients
   - Choose delivery format
   - The system will schedule generation during optimal network conditions

### Interpreting Operational Status

The dashboard includes indicators for:

1. **Load Shedding Status**
   - Green: No load shedding
   - Yellow: Stage 1-2 (minor outages)
   - Orange: Stage 3-4 (moderate outages)
   - Red: Stage 5+ (severe outages)

2. **Network Quality**
   - Green: Excellent connectivity
   - Teal: Good connectivity
   - Yellow: Fair connectivity
   - Orange: Poor connectivity
   - Red: Critical connectivity
   - Gray: Offline mode

## Performance Considerations

### Large Catalogs

For catalogs with more than 10,000 products:

1. Use the time period filters to limit the scope of data queries
2. Consider exporting data during off-peak hours
3. Enable data saving mode during load shedding periods
4. Utilize the catalog optimization tools before generating reports

### Low Bandwidth Environment

In low bandwidth environments:

1. Use the "minimal data" option when available
2. Consider scheduling regular report exports instead of on-demand generation
3. Limit the time range of reports to reduce data transfer
4. Use the text alternatives for visualizations

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Stock level forecasting
   - Demand prediction
   - Price elasticity analysis
   - Seasonal trend detection

2. **Advanced Visualizations**
