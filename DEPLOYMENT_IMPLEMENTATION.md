# Marketplace Scraper Deployment Implementation

This document provides an overview of the deployment implementation for the Fluxori Marketplace Scrapers on Google Cloud.

## Implementation Overview

I have created a comprehensive set of deployment scripts and configuration files that will allow you to deploy the marketplace scrapers to Google Cloud Platform with a simple, automated process. The implementation follows the architecture and design specified in the planning phase.

```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Infrastructure as Code

The deployment uses a combination of shell scripts and Terraform to create the infrastructure. All resources are defined programmatically for consistency and repeatability.

### 2. Phased Deployment Approach

The deployment is broken down into six phases:

1. **Foundation Infrastructure** - Project setup, API enabling, IAM roles
2. **Database Setup** - Firestore collections and indexes
3. **Application Deployment** - Container build and Cloud Run deployment
4. **Scheduler Setup** - Cloud Scheduler jobs for recurring tasks
5. **Monitoring Setup** - Dashboard and alert policies
6. **Validation and Testing** - System verification

### 3. Configuration Management

All configuration is externalized in JSON files, with reasonable defaults that can be customized as needed. This includes:
- Quota settings
- Marketplace configurations
- Scheduling parameters
- Monitoring thresholds

### 4. Security Implementation

Security best practices are implemented throughout:
- Secret Manager for API credentials
- Service accounts with minimal permissions
- Non-root container execution
- Secure communication channels

### 5. South African Optimizations

The deployment is optimized for South African market conditions:
- Deployment to africa-south1 (Johannesburg) region
- Load shedding detection and adaptation
- Conservative quota management for SmartProxy

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting

Comprehensive monitoring includes:
- Custom dashboard with all key metrics
- Alert policies for critical conditions
- Daily status reports
- Email notifications

### 7. Documentation

Detailed documentation is provided:
- Deployment guide with step-by-step instructions
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Monitoring guide for ongoing oversight
- Emergency recovery procedures

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the entire system, simply run:

```bash
cd /home/tarquin_stapa/fluxori
./deployment/setup.sh --project=fluxori-marketplace-data --region=africa-south1 \
  --smartproxy-token=YOUR_TOKEN --email=your-email@example.com
```

For more detailed instructions, refer to the `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` file in the deployment directory.

## Monitoring During Absence

The system is designed to run autonomously for your 3-week absence. To monitor it:

1. Set up a daily email report
2. Configure alerts to send to your email
3. Check the dashboard through the Google Cloud Console
4. Use the provided daily check script:

```bash
./deployment/scripts/run-daily-checks.sh --url=YOUR_SERVICE_URL
```

For a complete guide, see `MONITORING_GUIDE.md`.

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and maintainable deployment solution for the South African marketplace scrapers. It addresses all the requirements specified in the planning phase, with special attention to load shedding resilience, quota management, and autonomous operation.
